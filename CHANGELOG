We really need one of these now
20240712:
	cleaned up a lot of unneded TrimStart() lines
	added ApplePay info for Intel (will do same for Apple Silcon real soon, promise!)
	added BlueTooth info for Intel
	added POST test info for Intel

20240713 BIG APPLE SILCON CLEANUP
	fixed model name, one off error on array, grabbing 1 instead of 0
	same for macInfoModelID
	added macInfoModelNumber (doesn't exist on intel in system profiler SPHardWareDataType)
	split out apple silicon cores as total, performance, and efficiency
	added apple pay for apple silicon
	added bluetooth for Apple Silicon
	There's no POST test entry in system profiler for Apple Silicon, so that's not there

	may have to find a different way co calculate vm swap used

	updated macInfoDNSHostNameTest to allow for null return when not set
20250202 MASSIVE CHANGES
	rearchitected the system_profiler sections to use the JSON output to get info via directly addressing the items rather than  
	hoping for the best with "this is that line of the array in the output. WAY less fragile.  

	Redid the hash table building to eliminate an assload of duplicate entries. We now account for Apple Silicon/Intel differences  
	as we need them rather than duplicating the entire thing.  

	Added Power info for battery, AC power, and UPS.  

	Updated version to 2.0, this is a huge change
