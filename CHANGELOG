	added macInfoModelNumber (doesn't exist on intel in system profiler SPHardWareDataType)
	split out apple silicon cores as total, performance, and efficiency
	added apple pay for apple silicon
	added bluetooth for Apple Silicon
	There's no POST test entry in system profiler for Apple Silicon, so that's not there
